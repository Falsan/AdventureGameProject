Each file in the World folder will be a seperate scene.

Inside the file will be multiple records, with the type decided by the first entry of the record.

The types of records are

scn
cta

An scn record is the main record for each scene. It is structured as follows.

type|scene name|scene text

Scene name acts as a unique identifier as it is not shown anywhere

A cta record is a context action for the scene. It is structured as follows.

type|context action id|context action name|position in the UI|action this performs if any|scene this results in|scene this results in if check fails

Context action id acts as a unique identifier in the context of a scene. Context action name is the name of the context action shown in the UI

Names of scenes are the name of the scene in their given scene record

The actions a context action can perform are as follows.

UpdateWorld
UpdatePlayer
CheckWorld
CheckPlayer

Examples of their use are as follows

UpdateWorld,NPCRelationRank=1 will set the NPC relation rank to 1
UpdatePlayer,PlayerStrength+1 will add 1 to the player's strength variable

CheckWorld,NPCRelationRank,>,2 will check to see if the NPCRelationRank is greater than 2, if it is less, it will result in the fail scene
CheckPlayer,PlayerStrength,=,1 will check to see if the player strength matches 1, otherwise it will result in the fail scene

Context actions are assosiated with a scene. There can be many CTA records in a file, but only one SCN record.
